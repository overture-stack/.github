# Documenting Code (WIP)

Guidelines for documenting code effectively.

### Inline comments

- Use inline comments sparingly to explain complex logic or non-obvious decisions
- Keep inline comments brief and to the point
- Update or remove comments when the associated code changes
- Use TODO comments to mark areas needing future attention, include ticket numbers when applicable
- Avoid obvious comments that merely restate the code
- Use block comments for longer explanations

### Function/method documentation

- Document all public functions and methods
- Use a consistent documentation style 
    - Include a brief description of the function's purpose
    - Describe parameters, their types, and what they represent
    - Specify the return value and its type
    - Mention any exceptions that may be raised
- Provide usage examples for complex functions
