# Documenting Projects

Several documentation standards should be met at the level of the organization or project, as opposed to software repos and inline code.

The following organization documents, templates, and community health files should be included within a dedicated `.github` repository of the organization. This special repository acts as a centralized location for default community health files and templates for the entire organization. Files placed here will apply to all repositories within the organization that don't have their own specific versions of these files.
