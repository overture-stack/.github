# Support

We take pride in our software and are passionate about helping others use them. If you are looking for help or collaboration, here is how you can get in touch.

## GitHub Discussions

Our primary platform for community support, feature requests, and general discussions is GitHub Discussions. This allows us to keep all conversations in one place and make them easily searchable for future reference.

### Getting Help

- [**Create a Support Discussion**](https://github.com/overture-stack/docs/discussions/categories/support)
    - If you need assistance with Overture, please create a new discussion in our support category.
    - Before creating a new discussion, please search existing discussions to see if your question has already been answered.

### Feature Requests

We love hearing your ideas for improving Overture! Before making a feature request, please check our current roadmap to see if your idea is already planned:

- [**Overture feature roadmap](https://github.com/orgs/overture-stack/projects/11/views/1)

If your idea isn't on the roadmap, feel free to create a new discussion in our Ideas category:

- [**Submit a Feature Request**](https://github.com/overture-stack/docs/discussions/categories/ideas)

## GitHub Issues

We use GitHub Issues primarily for tracking confirmed bugs and ticketing development tasks.

### Reporting Bugs

If you come across a potential bug or issue, please post it as a GitHub support discussion first:

- [**Report a Potential Bug**](https://github.com/overture-stack/docs/discussions/categories/support)

This allows us to confirm the issue and gather more information if needed. If we determine that further development is required, we will create a GitHub Issue from your discussion post.

## Staying Informed

### Release Announcements

- [**Release Announcements**](https://github.com/overture-stack/docs/discussions/categories/announcements)
    - To stay up-to-date with the latest Overture releases and updates, keep an eye on our Announcements category in our GitHub Discussions

# Code of Conduct

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our
community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body
size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender
identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status,
nationality, personal appearance, caste, color, religion, or sexual
identity and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming,
diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment for our
community include:

* Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people
* Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
* Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
* Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes,
  and learning from the experience
* Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals, but for the overall
  community

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or advances of
  any kind
* Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or email address,
  without their explicit permission
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a
  professional setting

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of
acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in
response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive,
or harmful.

Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject
comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are
not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation
decisions when appropriate.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, and also applies when
an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces.
Examples of representing our community include using an official email address,
posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed
representative at an online or offline event.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be
reported to the community leaders responsible for enforcement at
[this email](contact@overture.bio).
All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

All community leaders are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the
reporter of any incident.

## Enforcement Guidelines

Community leaders will follow these Community Impact Guidelines in determining
the consequences for any action they deem in violation of this Code of Conduct:

### 1. Correction

**Community Impact**: Use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed
unprofessional or unwelcome in the community.

**Consequence**: A private, written warning from community leaders, providing
clarity around the nature of the violation and an explanation of why the
behavior was inappropriate. A public apology may be requested.

### 2. Warning

**Community Impact**: A violation through a single incident or series of
actions.

**Consequence**: A warning with consequences for continued behavior. No
interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with
those enforcing the Code of Conduct, for a specified period of time. This
includes avoiding interactions in community spaces as well as external channels
like social media. Violating these terms may lead to a temporary or permanent
ban.

### 3. Temporary Ban

**Community Impact**: A serious violation of community standards, including
sustained inappropriate behavior.

**Consequence**: A temporary ban from any sort of interaction or public
communication with the community for a specified period of time. No public or
private interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction
with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, is allowed during this period.
Violating these terms may lead to a permanent ban.

### 4. Permanent Ban

**Community Impact**: Demonstrating a pattern of violation of community
standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior, harassment of an
individual, or aggression toward or disparagement of classes of individuals.

**Consequence**: A permanent ban from any sort of public interaction within the
community.

- **Report a Potential Bug:** We use GitHub Issues primarily for tracking confirmed bugs and ticketing development tasks.

  - This allows us to confirm the issue and gather more information if needed. If we determine that further development is required, we will create and tag you into a GitHub Issue from your discussion post.

## Our Development Process

We use GitHub issues and pull requests for communication related to code changes. 

### Branch Organization

We use the following standard branches:

- `main` is for stable production code
- `develop` is the integration branch for new features
- `feature/<name>` for feature branches
- `release/v<version>` for release branches
- `hotfix/<name>` for hotfix branches

## Pull Requests

### Submitting a Pull Request

We welcome and encourage pull requests from the community. To submit a pull request, please follow these steps:

1. **Fork the Repository**: Fork the Overture repository on GitHub.
2. **Clone Your Fork**: Clone your forked repository to your local machine.
3. **Create a New Branch**: Create a new branch for your changes. Use lowercase and hyphens (e.g., `feature/user-authentication`). Include ticket/issue numbers when applicable (e.g., `feature/PROJ-123-user-authentication`).
4. **Make Your Changes**: Implement your changes and commit them to your branch. Write clear, concise commit messages in present tense (e.g., "Add feature" not "Added feature"). Reference issue numbers in commits when applicable.
5. **Push Your Changes**: Push your changes to your forked repository.
6. **Submit a Pull Request**: Open a pull request against the main repository.

### Best Practices

1. **Keep PRs as small as possible:** Focus on one feature or bug fix per pull request. Break large changes into smaller, more manageable pieces making it easier for reviewers to understand and approve your changes.

2. **Use descriptive titles:** Start with a verb (e.g., "Add", "Fix", "Update", "Refactor"), briefly summarize the main purpose of the PR and include the issue number if applicable (e.g., "Fix user authentication bug (#123)").

3. **Describe how you tested it:** Explain the testing process you followed and mention any new automated tests you've added.

4. **Provide a clear description:** Explain the purpose of your changes and list the main modifications you've made. Mention any potential side effects or areas that might need extra attention.

5. **Link related issues:** Reference any related issues or pull requests. Use GitHub keywords to automatically link issues (e.g., "Closes #123", "Fixes #456").
6. **Keep the PR's branch up-to-date:** Regularly rebase your branch on the latest main branch and resolve any merge conflicts promptly.

7. **Respond to feedback:** Be open to suggestions and willing to make changes. Address all comments from reviewers. If you disagree with a suggestion, explain your reasoning politely.

8. **Include documentation updates:** If your changes affect user-facing features, update or create and issue detailing the relevant changes need to the documentation. Where appropriate include inline comments for complex code sections.

10. **Be patient:** Reviewers will likely be unable to respond immediately. However, feel free to follow up politely if you haven't received feedback after a reasonable time.

### Using Draft Pull Requests

Draft Pull Requests are an excellent way to document work in progress and facilitate early feedback. Use them to:

- Organize your thoughts and process
- Share early work and ideas with the team
- Get feedback on implementation approaches before finalizing code
- Track progress on long-running features

Guidelines for Draft Pull Requests:

1. **Creation**:
   - Open a pull request and select "Create draft pull request"
   - Clearly mark the title with [WIP] or [DRAFT] prefix
2. **Description**:
   - Outline the current state of the work
   - List planned tasks or improvements
   - Highlight areas where feedback is specifically needed
3. **Updates**:
   - Regularly update the description or provide comments following commits with progress notes
- Use task lists (using `- [ ]` in Markdown) to track completion of sub-tasks
4. **Collaboration**:
   - Encourage early feedback and discussion
   - Use the pull request comments for design discussions
5. **Finalization**:
   - Complete all planned work and address feedback
   - Update tests and documentation
   - Click "Ready for review" to move out of draft state

### Merging a Pull Request

- Ensure all CI checks pass
- Obtain the required number of approvals
- Use the project's specified merge strategy (Typically squash and merge)
- Delete the source branch after merging if no longer needed
