# Setup

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

- [Prerequisite 1] (version X or higher)
- [Prerequisite 2] (version Y or higher)
- [Prerequisite 3] (version Z or higher)

## Developer Setup

This guide will walk you through setting up a complete development environment for [Service Name], including its complementary services.

### Setting up supporting services

We'll use Conductor to spin up [Service Name]'s complementary services.

1. Clone the Conductor repository and move into its directory:

   ```bash
   git clone [repository-url]
   cd [repository-directory]
   ```

2. Run the appropriate start command for your operating system:

   | Operating System | Command             |
   | ---------------- | ------------------- |
   | Unix/macOS       | `[unix-command]`    |
   | Windows          | `[windows-command]` |

    <details>
    <summary>**Click here for a detailed breakdown**</summary>

   This command will set up all complementary services for [Service Name] development as follows:

   ![Dev Environment Diagram](../images/platform.svg '[Service Name] Dev Environment')

   | Service         | Port   | Description                    | Purpose in [Service Name] Development |
   | --------------- | ------ | ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------ |
   | [Service 1]     | [Port] | [Brief description]            | [Purpose in development]             |
   | [Service 2]     | [Port] | [Brief description]            | [Purpose in development]             |
   | [Service 3]     | [Port] | [Brief description]            | [Purpose in development]             |

   - Ensure all ports are free on your system before starting the environment.
   - You may need to adjust the ports in the configuration file if you have conflicts with existing services.

   For more information on configuring and using these services, see our Conductor documentation

    </details>

In the next steps, we will run a [Service Name] development server against these supporting services.

### Running the Development Server

1. Clone [Service Name] and move into its directory:

   ```bash
   git clone [service-repository-url]
   cd [service-directory]
   ```

2. Configure environment variables:

   ```bash
   mv [example-env-file] .env
   ```

    :::info

    This `.env` file is preconfigured as follows for the [Service Name] environment:
   
    ```env
        # Variables subtitle
        KEY1=value

        # Variables subtitle
        KEY2=value
    ```

    <details>
    <summary>**Click here for an explanation of [Service Name] environment variables**</summary>

    - **Variable Subtitle**
        - `KEY1`: Definition

    - **Variable Subtitle**
        - `KEY2`: Definition


    </details>

3. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm ci
   ```

   :::tip
   [Any relevant tips or version requirements]
   :::

4. Start the [Service Name] development server:

   ```bash
   [start-server-command]
   ```

### Verification

After installation and configuration, verify that [Service Name] is functioning correctly:

1. **Check the [Service Name] UI**

   - Navigate to `[service-url]` in a web browser.
   - Expected result: [Description of expected result]
   - Troubleshooting:
     - [Troubleshooting step 1]
     - [Troubleshooting step 2]

2. **Test [Key Functionality 1]**

   - [Steps to test functionality]
   - Expected result: [Description of expected result]
   - Troubleshooting:
     - [Troubleshooting step 1]
     - [Troubleshooting step 2]

3. **Test [Key Functionality 2]**
   - [Steps to test functionality]
   - Expected result: [Description of expected result]
