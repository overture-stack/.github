# Documenting Software 

The following pages define the minimum standard of developer documentation required within an Overture project, which include:

1. A **`Readme.md`** file.
2. A **`/docs`** folder with the following basic structure:

    ```
    .
    └── docs/
        ├── 01-Overview/
        │   └── 01-Overview.md
        ├── 02-Setup.md
        └── 03-Guides/
            ├── 01-Usage.md
            ├── 02-Development.md
            └── 03-Deployment.md
    ```

    :::tip

    To ensure your folders and files are ordered correctly in the sidebar use the numbered naming convention seen above.

    :::

3. A **`CONTRIBUTING.md`** file
4. A **`code_of_conduct`** file
5. A **`license.md`** file

## Markdown formatting 

When adding and editing markdown files within the project repository there are a few considerations to be made to ensure your files get rendered correctly by docusaurus:

- The top level heading (ex. # Top Title) will be used by docusaurus for the sidebar label

- Docusaurus supports [tabs](https://docusaurus.io/docs/markdown-features/tabs), [dropdowns](https://docusaurus.io/docs/markdown-features#details) and [admonitions](https://docusaurus.io/docs/markdown-features/admonitions) however to maintain portability and readability of the raw markdown **we do not recommend using them**.

## Images & Diagrams

Images and diagrams can be valuable, but they can take lots of time and require maintenance. When using images or diagrams, consider how beneficial the visualization will be and how frequently you need to update it. 

- Both Docusaurus and GitHub supports [rendering of Mermaid](https://docusaurus.io/docs/markdown-features/diagrams), feel free to use this for any diagrams. For more information, see the official [GitHub Docs on creating Mermaid diagrams](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/working-with-advanced-formatting/creating-diagrams).


## GitHub Templates

If you are creating a repository from scratch you can use a pre-configured repository template on github.

## Writing Guidelines

### Language

We use Canadian English (en-CA) as our standard language for all written and verbal communication.

#### Use an Active Voice

The active voice is concise and more accessible for readers to comprehend. Active voice is naturally used in conversation and therefore, readers understand and engage more with writing in the active voice.

| 👎 Disengaging| 👍 Engaging|
|---|---|
|The developer environment has been set up successfully.|We have successfully set up the developer environment.|
|The necessary tools and dependencies are being installed.|We are installing the necessary tools and dependencies.|

#### Put Conditional Clauses First

Put conditional clauses up front in sentences. With conditional clauses upfront, readers can skim or skip information they do not require. If done consistently, this saves significant time reading irrelevant information.

| 👎 Slow | 👍 Skimmable |
|---|---|
|See How to Use the Score Client for more information | For more information, see How to Use the Score Client.|
| Set the analysis state to published, this will enable the analysis to be indexed| To index the analysis, set the analysis state to published |

#### Write Accessibly

Take note of how you describe software behaviours or user actions. Each reader will have a unique background and familiarity with the content, so avoid using language that assumes knowledge.

| 👎 Sets expectations that can lead to frustration| 👍 No assumptions, made reader friendly|
|---|---|
|Start by *simply* entering the following command|Start by entering the following command|
|To *easily* interact with our API see the Song Swagger UI| To interact with our API see the Song Swagger UI|

Whenever possible, also include descriptive links to prerequisite or contextual material. Our services benefit a variety of people and data; therefore, experience levels and fields of expertise can vary significantly from user to user. 

### Formatting & Punctuation

#### Headers

Use level 1 headers at the top of the page and divide your document using the lower level headers for subsections.

- Capitalize the first word of a title or subtitle, even if it is a little word like "The" or "A."
- Capitalize the first word after a colon and dash (ex., "Self-Report" instead of "Self-report").
- Capitalize words of four letters or more (e.g., "With," "Between," and "From").
- Except for the above rules, lowercase minor words that are three letters or fewer in a title or subtitle.

#### Numbered lists vs bulleted points

- Numbered lists for sequential items
- Bulleted points for all other lists

#### Commas

Use an Oxford comma for a list of three or more items.

| Can lead to confusion | Clearer separatation |
|---|---|
|I had eggs, toast and orange juice for breakfast.|I had eggs, toast, and orange juice for breakfast.|
