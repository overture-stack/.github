We build software that enables researchers and the public to access, manage and study large amounts of genomics data.

Central to our work is Overture, our suite of open-source & freely available modular software microservices. Each service has been generalized with narrow responsibilities that combine to form powerful data platforms where researchers can organize, share and explore their genomics data.

By sharing these tools we aim to promote the growth and development of reliable genomic data management systems quickly, flexibly, and at multiple scales.
